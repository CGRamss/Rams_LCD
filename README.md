# Rams_LCD
This library is for Liquid Crystal Display 16x2 (ADM1602)

25 Juli 2024

This is a 16x2 LCD library for Arduino or standalone ATmega328. It may also be compatible with ESP microcontrollers, 
though I have not had the opportunity to test it on other platforms due to time and budget constraints.

If you encounter any issues with this library, please accept my apologies as I am still getting accustomed to programming in C.

I also include a Proteus file you can try, you just need the HEX File from Arduino IDE and then put it on ATmega328 in the Proteus File

You need the HEX File and put it here
